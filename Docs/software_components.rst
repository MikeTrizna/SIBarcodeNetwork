Software components
===================

Field Information Management System (FIMS) - GeOMe
-------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of a field information management system, or FIMS, is to store information relating to fieldwork (e.g. specimen records, collecting events, identification, etc.) The FIMS being used by the SI Barcode Network is The Genomic Observatories Meta-Database (GeOMe) FIMS. The SI Barcode Network is using a cloud-hosted version that is available at https://geome-db.org/. All that you need to use the GeOMe FIMS is a spreadsheet program (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.), and a browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).

Geneious Prime software program
-------------------------

The SI Barcode Network uses the Geneious Prime molecular biology software package to run the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) portion of the project, and for assembly of sequences and submission to GenBank. Geneious Prime is a cross-platform (works equally well on Windows, Mac, and Linux) program that provides a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) to many classic molecular biology tools in a layout similar to an e-mail client. Geneious Prime is a commercial software that is not free, but the Smithsonian has a floating institution license available to users within the Smithsonian network. You can find more information about Geneious Prime at their website: http://www.geneious.com/.

Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
-----------------------------------------------

The LIMS allows you to manage your laboratory and sequence editing workflows.
